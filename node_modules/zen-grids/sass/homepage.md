## Zen Grids 2.0

### Reference documentation

This documentation is for the new 2.0 version of Zen Grids. Pardon our dust while we get the _design_ up-to-date. Rest asured, the docs are up-to-date.

For the previous Zen Grids 1.x documentation, see [v1.zengrids.com](http://v1.zengrids.com).

### Modules

Zen Grids 2.0 is divided into small modules that small and logical, making it easy to load and easier to understand.

- [The “grids” module](section-grids.html) contains most of the configurable variables and mixins you’ll need to create a layout.
- [The “flow” module](section-flow.html) helps align normal flow items within a grid.
- [The “layout” module](section-layout.html) helps to create a set of grids for responsive designs.
- [The “undo” module](section-undo.html) helps undo CSS applied in different media queries.
- [The “helper functions” module](section-functions.html) contains functions you may need to create a layout.
- [The “background” module](section-background.html) is used during development to help see the grid columns
