#### By Aundra Miller
##### Forked from `dianedouglas/cameron_bakery`

## Description

This is a basic fictional website for a bakery. Any bugs that were originally in the code have been removed, and two new themes added. One theme is custom, and the other is a subtheme of the original theme Zen. A small piece of JavaScript has been added to the custom theme's navigation bar.

## Setup

* Set document root to the top level directory of the repository

* Create a user for the database: username = "cameron", password = "cameron"
* Point browser to localhost
