# Cameron's Bakery

##### Epicodus Drupal Code Review 3

#### By Diane Douglas and Tim Bourgault

## Description

This is a basic fictional website for a bakery, which comes with a buggy custom module.
I have fixed the custom module bakery_user so that it directs a user to the welcome page once they have signed in.  I have also created my  own custom module which excludes the subject line from any comments that users submit under an article.  Finally, I created my own custom theme called Retrovertigo which includes some JavaScript, and a Zen sub-theme that is a variation on the original Zen theme.

## Setup
