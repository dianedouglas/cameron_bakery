##### Epicodus Drupal Code Review 3

#### By Diane Douglas, extended by Nic Netzel for Epicodus Drupal Code Review 3

## Description

This is a basic fictional website for a bakery that has been cleaned of bugs that were preventing it from opening and running correctly. Additionally it includes two custom themes:  "simplest theme" -- a very brown and boring theme made from scratch, and "netZen" -- a Zen Sub-theme styled around a bluberry muffin, each which uses a very simple javascript/jQuery mouse hover function.  It includes a custom module "hide_comment_subject" that alters the form for comment sumbission to remove the 'subject' field.
