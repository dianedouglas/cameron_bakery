# Cameron's Bakery

##### Epicodus Drupal Code Review 3

#### By Alex Fallenstedt

## Description

This is a basic fictional website for a bakery, which comes with a buggy custom module.
Students must fix the module, add their own custom module and a Zen sub-theme. This code review will fulfill the following objectives:

* Did you successfully fork an existing Drupal website repository, set up a local development environment for it and fix the bugs causing it to be inaccessible?
* Did you create your own custom module to alter the site as stated in the requirements?
* Did you create both a custom theme and a sub theme for your client to choose between?
* Did you include some JavaScript in at least one of your themes?
* Is your code clean and correctly indented?
* Did you include a readme on your fork of the repository, regularly make clear Git commits and submit your changes as a pull request?
* Are you able to discuss the flow of your code and the concepts behind it with an instructor using correct terminology?

## Setup

* Clone this repository
* Set document root to the top level directory of the repository
* Import the database, called "bakery", found in `sites/db-backup`
* Create a user for the database: username = "cameron", password = "cameron"
* Point browser to localhost
* Site maintenance account info: username = "cameron", password = "cameron"
