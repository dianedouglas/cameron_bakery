# Cameron's Bakery

##### Epicodus Drupal Code Review 3

#### Edited By Jordan Meier

## Description

This is a basic fictional website for a bakery, which comes with a buggy custom module.
Students must fix the module, add their own custom module and a Zen sub-theme.

## Notes

Cameron, just wanted to let you know that I created the module to hide the subject field from article comments like you wanted, but the article comment settings were set to not allow comments. I kept comment settings 'closed', but thought I would let ya know in case you didn't realize.

## Setup

* Clone this repository
* Set document root to the top level directory of the repository
* Import the database, called "bakery", found in `sites/db-backup`
* Create a user for the database: username = "cameron", password = "cameron"
* Point browser to localhost
* Site maintenance account info: username = "cameron", password = "cameron"
