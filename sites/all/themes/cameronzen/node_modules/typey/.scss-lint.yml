# Documentation for the scss-lint Linters is available at:
# https://github.com/causes/scss-lint/blob/master/lib/scss_lint/linter/README.md
#
# This file is for new projects with no pre-existing styles. If you are adding
# linting to an existing project, use the following command to create a
# .scss-lint.yml file instead: scss-lint --format=Config -o .scss-lint.yml
# Then go through each linter, one at a time, disabling it and fixing the
# warnings in your code.
