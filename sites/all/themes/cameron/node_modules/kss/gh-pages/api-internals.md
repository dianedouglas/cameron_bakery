# kss-node API<br><small>version: `master` branch</small>

This is the JavaScript API documentation for the kss-node software. **This version of the documentation includes internal, private modules and methods.**

If you are *not* a developer fixing bugs or adding features to kss-node, a version of the documentation with just the [kss-node public JavaScript API](../) is available.
